This lab consisted of one main task. Our job was to take the single cycle CPU processor we made in Lab 2 and enhance it using pipelining. We were also supposed to deal with the data hazards and errors that come with pipelining by creating a hazard control unit, and using that to ensure the data was what we wanted.
